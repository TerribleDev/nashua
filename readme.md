# A travel guide to Nashua, NH, USA


## AKA The Gate City

Hello, and welcome to the *gate city*. We are happy you are visiting. Nashua is a a half hour drive from Manchester, and an hour drive to Boston and Portsmouth. We're famous for having a [Dunder Mifflin](http://theoffice.wikia.com/wiki/Dunder_Mifflin_Nashua) branch in the show *The Office*. We were twice named one of the best places to live by [Money magazine](http://time.com/money/5108196/best-places-to-live-every-state-us/).
